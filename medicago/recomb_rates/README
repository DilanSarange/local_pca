Dear Peter (cc Han Li and P. Tiffin)

Attached is the filtered dataset we analysed for the paper.  If you need =
the unfiltered datasets I can send them, feel free to let me know if you =
have any other questions or requests.


"We did not include windows with less than five SNPs
per window because the accuracy of q estimates may be low
when estimated using few SNPs. We also excluded estimates
from windows with more than 25 SNPs because of
the possibility that these highly polymorphic windows reflect
errors in SNP variant calling, leaving a remaining
34,356 windows. Because this filtering may affect correlations
and include comparisons of 1 kb filtered and unfiltered
data set, correlations are presented in supplementary table
S1 (Supplementary Material online)."

best regards
Tim

and linkage map from Peter Tiffin, 8/17/16:
( saved second sheet, edited out extraneous rows at the end )

Peter,

i think you also had asked about any information we might have on an updated genetic map (or perhaps I'm just confused by too many emails today, in which case just ignore this one).  I don't know of anything.  The only one I know of is several years old (a paper by Mun et al.) which is attached.  The map was generated from a single cross, and the marker density is pretty sparse (column B in attached spreadsheet).

I've also attached a spreadsheet in which we related physical to genetic map (part of a paper by Branca et al.).  I don't know if this is at all helpful.  The physical map locations are assembly 3.0.
