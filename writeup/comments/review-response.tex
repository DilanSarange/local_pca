Things to address in simulation:

- compare with background selection to neutral
- variation in recombination rate - still finds background selection?

Things to describe in simulation results:

- PC switching
- number of PCs chosen
- what weighting fixes
- what trace normalization fixes 
    (mutation density - choose windows with different numbers of snps)

Simulations:

All on a 8x8 grid (square to induce PC switching),
subpopulation size 100, for 32K generations.
Neutral mutation rate 1e-5 (so divergence will be 0.1).

Sexual, one chromosome of length 1 morgan.

- Neutral, flat recombination.
- Neutral, with recombination rate increasing linearly from 0 to 2.
- Neutral, with recombination hot spots.
- Recombination as above, with selection against mutants with s=.01 at 1,000 uniformly distributed sites.


Other points to discuss:

- relate to PCAdmix
- show different window choice results we reference
- clarify we checked for variation in missingness, provide plot of MDS against missingness
- could neutrality + admixture explain drosophila? reference recent Neanderthal papers.
