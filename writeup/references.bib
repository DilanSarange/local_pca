  abstract = {The fixation of advantageous mutations by natural selection has a profound impact on patterns of linked neutral variation. While it has long been appreciated that such selective sweeps influence the frequency spectrum of nearby polymorphism, it has only recently become clear that they also have dramatic effects on local linkage disequilibrium. By extending previous results on the relationship between genealogical structure and linkage disequilibrium, I obtain simple expressions for the influence of a selective sweep on patterns of allelic association. I show that sweeps can increase, decrease, or even eliminate linkage disequilibrium (LD) entirely depending on the relative position of the selected and neutral loci. I also show the importance of the age of the neutral mutations in predicting their degree of association and describe the consequences of such results for the interpretation of empirical data. In particular, I demonstrate that while selective sweeps can eliminate LD, they generate patterns of genetic variation very different from those expected from recombination hotspots.},

  abstract = {Positive natural selection is the force that drives the increase in prevalence of advantageous traits, and it has played a central role in our development as a species. Until recently, the study of natural selection in humans has largely been restricted to comparing individual candidate genes to theoretical expectations. The advent of genome-wide sequence and polymorphism data brings fundamental new tools to the study of natural selection. It is now possible to identify new candidates for selection and to reevaluate previous claims by comparison with empirical distributions of DNA sequence variation across the human genome and among populations. The flood of data and analytical methods, however, raises many new challenges. Here, we review approaches to detect positive natural selection, describe results from recent analyses of genome-wide data, and discuss the prospects and challenges ahead as we expand our understanding of the role of natural selection in shaping the human genome.},

@article{sella2009pervasive,
  abstract = {Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular evolution saw little connection between natural selection and genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies rely upon segregating natural genetic variation, particularly the patterns of polymorphism and correlation between adjacent markers. To facilitate association studies in the model legume Medicago truncatula, we present a genome-scale polymorphism scan using existing Affymetrix microarrays. We develop and validate a method that uses a simple information-criteria algorithm to call polymorphism from microarray data without reliance on a reference genotype. We genotype 12 inbred M. truncatula lines sampled from four wild Tunisian populations and find polymorphisms at approximately 7% of features, comprising 31 419 probes. Only approximately 3% of these markers assort by population, and of these only 10% differentiate between populations from saline and non-saline sites. Fifty-two differentiated probes with unique genome locations correspond to 18 distinct genome regions. Sanger resequencing was used to characterize a subset of maker loci and develop a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing assay that confirmed marker assortment by habitat in an independent sample of 33 individuals from the four populations. Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) extends on average for approximately 10 kb, falling to background levels by approximately 500 kb. A similar range of LD decay was observed in the 18 genome regions that assort by habitat; these LD blocks delimit candidate genes for local adaptation, many of which encode proteins with predicted functions in abiotic stress tolerance and are targets for functional genomic studies. Tunisian M. truncatula populations contain substantial amounts of genetic variation that is structured in relatively small LD blocks, suggesting a history of migration and recombination. These populations provide a strong resource for genome-wide association studies.},

  abstract = {There has been an enormous increase in the amount of data on DNA sequence polymorphism available for many organisms in the last decade. New sequencing technologies provide great potential for investigating natural selection in plants using population genomic approaches. However, plant populations frequently show significant departures from the assumptions of standard models used to detect selection and many forms of directional selection do not fit with classical population genetics theory. Here, we explore the extent to which plant populations show departures from standard model assumptions, and the implications this has for detecting selection on molecular variation. A growing number of multilocus studies of nucleotide variation suggest that changes in population size, particularly bottlenecks, and strong subdivision may be common in plants. This demographic variation presents important challenges for models used to infer selection. In addition, selection from standing genetic variation and multiple independent adaptive substitutions can further complicate efforts to understand the nature of selection. We discuss emerging patterns from plant studies and propose that, rather than treating population history as a nuisance variable when testing for selection, the interaction between demography and selection is of fundamental importance for evolutionary studies of plant populations using molecular data.},

@article{kaplan1989hitchhiking,
  abstract = {The number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes can be affected by ancestral selectively favored substitutions at linked loci. The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

  abstract = {The hitchhiking effect of a beneficial mutation, or a selective sweep, generates a unique distribution of allele frequencies and spatial distribution of polymorphic sites. A composite-likelihood test was previously designed to detect these signatures of a selective sweep, solely on the basis of the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms. As an excess of linkage disequilibrium (LD) is also known to be a strong signature of a selective sweep, we investigate how much statistical power is increased by the inclusion of information regarding LD. The expected pattern of LD is predicted by a genealogical approach. Both theory and simulation suggest that strong LD is generated in narrow regions at both sides of the location of beneficial mutation. However, a lack of LD is expected across the two sides. We explore various ways to detect this signature of selective sweeps by statistical tests. A new composite-likelihood method is proposed to incorporate information regarding LD. This method enables us to detect selective sweeps and estimate the parameters of the selection model better than the previous composite-likelihood method that does not take LD into account. However, the improvement made by including LD is rather small, suggesting that most of the relevant information regarding selective sweeps is captured by the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms.},

Growing the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in field experiments in four sites across the species’ native range, we identified candidate loci for local adaptation from a genome-wide association study of lifetime fitness in geographically diverse accessions. Fitness-associated loci exhibited both geographic and climatic signatures of local adaptation. Relative to genomic controls, high-fitness alleles were generally distributed closer to the site where they increased fitness, occupying specific and distinct climate spaces. Independent loci with different molecular functions contributed most strongly to fitness variation in each site.
